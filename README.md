Profile

Hi all! My name is Lucy (she/her) and I am a first year MURP student concentrating in EAP. I am originally from Boulder, Colorado, and completed my undergrad at the University of Colorado, Denver in Geography. I am passionate about public health, environmental justice, food systems, and climate adaptation. I am particularly interested in the intersection of climate and housing justice. I have been exploring geospatial skills since undergrad, but have mostly learned about ESRI products and remote sensing. I am excited to move to the next level with my geospatial skills and learn to code. 

Course Description
-

This course is designed to give us open-source skills in geospatial technology. The course will teach us data engineering through programming, data analysis, spatial analysis, and cartography. 

Project ideas
- 
* I am currently working on a project looking at the proximity of California oil wells to schools, skilled nursing facilites, hospitals, and daycares. I would love to make a more meaningful analysis than just displaying the data on a map. 
* I am interested in looking at admissions data for California high schools to understand racial and class disparities. 
* My first GIS project ever was looking at sea level rise and social vulnerability to climate change in the Philippines. I would be interested in revisiting this subject now that I have more skills. 

Objectives for the Course
-
I feel I have a good grasp of basic geospatial analysis skills, so I hope to gain more autonomy and control outside of ESRI products. I am interested in learning about the advantages of different platforms for mapping.
